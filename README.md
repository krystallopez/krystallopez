## About Me

- I am actively participating in a 15-month apprenticeship, and in the last phase 
- Currently learning React and will be learning Python and Django
- In my free time, I love reading and gaming. I am a huge Star Wars fan and am an avid collector.

<!---My name is Krystal Lopez, I love all things pop culture, especially Star Wars. I am a software engineer currently working as an Engineering Associate at Cisco Systems. I have recently learned JavaScript and I am now learning Python. What was once just curiosity has now turned into a career for me and I love learning new things. I am currently working on mastering React and improving my skills in JavaScript. I am also learning Python as well. -->
